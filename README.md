# Ansible Docker Setup Demo

This mini-project demonstrates a simple web interface for simulating Ansible playbook execution for Docker setup using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description
- **Configuration Form**: Input host details and Docker services.
- **Execute Button**: Simulates running an Ansible playbook by displaying output.
- **Output Log**: Shows simulated Ansible output for Docker installation and container management.

## Instructions
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Fill in the form and click "Execute Playbook" to see simulated output.
3. Extend this by integrating actual Ansible scripts or Docker commands via Node.js.

Note: This is a frontend simulation; for real Ansible-Docker integration, use Ansible collections like community.docker.
